MFT
•	Multiprogramming with fixed tasks (MFT) 
•	Memory is divided into several fixed-size partitions. 
•	Each partition may contain exactly one process/task.
•	Boundaries for partitions are set at boot time and are not movable. 
•	An input queue per partition
•	The degree of multiprogramming is bound by the number of partitions.
•	Potential for wasted memory space—an empty partition but no process in the associated queue
•	Load-time address binding
•	Single queue for all partitions
•	Search the queue for a process when a partition becomes empty 
•	Types of space allocation algorithms
a.First-fit---first present partition will be allocated to te coming process
b.best-fit---partition which is most optimum for the entering process will be occupied.
c. worst-fit---coming process is allocated to the partition with maximum size and is  unoccupied .

ISSUES of MFT

•	Internal fragmentation—wasted space inside a fixedsize memory region.
•	No sharing between processes.
•	Load-time address binding with multiple input queues.


MVT

•	A single big block of fixed size without any fixed sized  partitions insideit  will occupy the incoming processes.Hence jobs can move from one partition to another .
•	Dynamic address binding of processes. 
•	No internal fragmentation.
•	Types of space allocation algorithms
a.First-fit--- processes will occupy the block in a contiguos fashion i.e when they encounter first empty space where they can fit in ,that space will be occupied.
b.best-fit---partition which is most optimum for the entering process will be occupied.
c. worst-fit---coming process is allocated to the partition with maximum size and is  unoccupied .


ISSUES OF MVT:
•	Introduces external fragmentation.
